\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

In order to demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted three sets
of tests.
In the first we simulated observables from a set of stellar parameters for a
few hundred stars using the MIST stellar evolution models and the
gyrochronology model of equation \ref{eqn:gyro}.
The ages predicted with our model were compared to the true parameters used to
generate the data.
In the second we tested our model by measuring the ages of individual stars in
the NGC 6819 open cluster, and in the third we tested our model on \kepler\
asteroseismic stars.

\subsection{Test 1: simulated stars}
For the first test we drew masses, ages, bulk metallicities, distances and
extinctions at random for 1000 stars from the following uniform distributions:
\begin{eqnarray}
& \mathrm{EEP} \sim U(198, 480) \\
% & M \sim U(0.5, 1.5)~[M_\odot] \\
& t \sim U(0.5, 14)\mathrm{~[Gyr]} \\
& [Fe/H] \sim U(-0.2, 0.2) \\
& D \sim U(10, 1000)~\mathrm{[pc]} \\
& A_V \sim U(0, 0.1).
\end{eqnarray}
\teff, \logg, \fhat, parallax, and apparent magnitudes $B$, $V$, $J$, $H$, $K$,
\gaia\ $G$, $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$ were generated from these
stellar parameters using the MIST stellar evolution models.
We added a small amount of noise to the `observed' stellar properties in order
to reflect optimistic observational uncertainties for isochrone-dating.
We added Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 25 K to \teff, 0.01 dex
to \feh\ and \logg, and 10 mmags to $B$, $V$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ magnitudes.
These are just one choice of uncertainties that we could have adopted and are
extremely optimistic.
The uncertainties on predicted ages {\it will} depend strongly on all
observational uncertainties, however, since this analysis is designed to show
the relative improvement in stellar age precision when {\it rotation periods}
are included, we chose to use best-case spectroscopic parameters.
The noise added to Gaia $G$-band photometry ranged from
0.3 mmag for stars brighter than 13th magnitude, to 10 mmag for stars
around 20th magnitude \citep{evans2017, brown2018}.
Noise added to \gaia\ $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$ bands ranged from 2 mmag for stars
brighter than 13th magnitude to 200 mmag for stars fainter than 17th.
Unphysical combinations of stellar parameters were discarded, resulting in a
final sample size of 841 simulated stars.
Figure \ref{fig:CMD_age} shows the position of these stars on an HRD
(with \logg\ on the y-axis instead of luminosity to improve the visibility of
the MS), colored by their age.
Rotation periods for these stars were generated using the gyrochronology
relation described in equation \ref{eqn:gyro}.
We added 5\% Gaussian noise to all stellar rotation periods to represent
realistic measurement uncertainties of 5\%.
The median uncertainty on rotation periods calculated from \kepler\ light
curves, provided in the \citet{mcquillan2014} catalog is 1\%.
However, the \citet{aigrain2015} injection and recovery study showed that true
rotation period uncertainties are often slightly larger than this, and noise
distribution of rotation periods can be highly non-Gaussian
\citep[\eg][]{aigrain2015, angus2018}.

We took two approaches to inferring the ages of these simulated stars:
firstly using isochrone fitting {\it only}, and secondly using isochrone
fitting {\it combined with} a gyrochronology model (\sd).
Since the posterior PDFs of stars are often multimodal, we found that the
choice of initial positions of the {\tt emcee} walkers influenced the final
outcome because walkers occasionally got stuck in local minima.
We found that the following set of initial parameters worked well, though not
perfectly: EEP = 330, $t = 9.56$ Gyr, $[M/H] = -0.05$, $D = 269$ pc and $A_V =
0.0$\footnote{These are the default initial parameters provided in \sd.}.
Figure \ref{fig:simulation_results} shows the results of combining
gyrochronology with isochrone fitting for the simulated sample.
The stars' true ages are plotted against their predicted ages, with ages
inferred with gyrochronology and isochrone fitting
in color, and ages inferred using isochrone fitting only plotted in light
grey.
The different panels show the results for different types of stars: FGK
dwarfs that are still undergoing magnetic braking, FGK dwarfs that have ceased
magnetic braking (their Rossby number is around 2), M dwarfs, and evolved
stars.
The selection criteria for these groups are in the panel headings.
The FGK dwarfs with low Rossby numbers showed the largest improvement: the
median age precision for this group (defined as the standard deviation of the
posterior as a percentage of the median age) was 8\% when using a combination
of isochrones and gyrochronology, and 22\% using isochrone fitting alone.
This equates to an almost 3$\times$ improvement in age precision.
The age RMS of this group was 0.8 Gyr using isochrones and gyrochronology, and
2 Gyr using isochrones only.
Despite the fact that stars with Rossby numbers of 2 have stopped spinning
down and their rotation periods no longer evolve with age, the ages of these
stars can still be relatively precisely constrained with isochrone fitting.
The median age precision for stars with large Rossby numbers was 11\% with
gyrochronology and isochrone fitting, and 13\% with isochrone fitting only.
% This is because their rotation periods are still directly related to their
% age, but also {\it indirectly} related to their age via EEP and metallicity,
% as shown in equation \ref{eqn:gyro}.
% When including rotation periods to infer the ages of stars with large Rossby
% numbers, age precision improves from 21\% to 11\% and the age RMS improves
% from 2.5 to 0.9 Gyr.
% Age precision also increases for F dwarfs when incorporating their rotation
% periods, even though they are not directly related to their ages.
% This is because rotation period relates to color via the variance model in
% equation \ref{eqn:gyro}.
The precision of M dwarf ages did improve overall when their rotation periods
were included, but this improvement was entirely driven by the early M dwarfs.
The precision of this group improved overall from 33\% to 22\% and RMS from
5.4 Gyr to 4.6 Gyr.
The precision of ages inferred for evolved stars changed very little when
rotation periods were included in the inference process.
This is because the variance of the rotation-age relation was inflated by a
large amount in the gyrochronology model (equation \ref{eqn:gyro}), making
rotation periods almost entirely uninformative for this group.
The median age precision of subgiants from both gyrochronology and isochrone
fitting and isochrone fitting alone was 7\%.

\begin{figure}
  \caption{
The true vs. predicted ages of simulated stars.
    Ages calculated by combining gyrochronology
    and isochrone fitting with \sd\ are shown in color and ages calculated with
    isochrone fitting only are shown in gray.
The different panels show the results for stars
    with \gcolor\ $<$ 2.2 (FGK dwarfs) that are still braking magnetically
    ($Ro < 2$), stars with \gcolor\ $<$ 2.2 that have stopped braking
    magnetically ($Ro \geq 2$),
    stars with 2.2 $<$ \gcolor\ (M dwarfs), and evolved stars (EEP $>$ 420).
Gyrochronology is highly effective for FGK stars and ages inferred with both
    gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are more accurate and precise than
    ages inferred via isochrone fitting only for this group.
Neither gyrochronology nor isochrone fitting can provide precise ages for
    M dwarfs, so the ages of these stars are imprecise regardless of
    age-dating method.

An important caveat associated with these results is that they strongly depend
on the uncertainties adopted for all observables used in the analysis: \teff,
\feh, \logg, $G$, $G_BP$, $G_RP$, $J$, $H$, $K$, $B$, $V$, and rotation
period.
Changing the uncertainties on these observables will affect the uncertainties
on inferred ages in different ways.
This demonstration is not intended to reflect the typical age uncertainties
that will result for all stars in reality, it merely exemplifies the increase
in stellar age precision that results from one specific choice of
uncertainties.
Needless to say, estimating the uncertainties on observables accurately can be
as important as accurately measuring the observables themselves.

% Figure \ref{fig:eep} shows the inferred equivalent evolutionary phase (EEP)
% for the simulated star sample.
% EEP is a dimensionless number that describes evolutionary stage and, combined
% with age and metallicity, determines stellar mass.
% An interesting result of inferring stellar properties with both isochrones
% {\it and} rotation periods is an increase in EEP precision, .
% The reason for this is partly that EEP and age are correlated, so shrinking
% the age posterior also shrinks the EEP posterior, and partly because rotation
% period is a function of HRD position.
% As shown in equation \ref{eqn:gyro}, rotation period does not just depend on
% color and age, but also on EEP and [Fe/H].

% In general, the posterior PDFs of stellar properties, inferred using
% isochrones or stellar evolution models, are multimodal.
% The stars with under-predicted EEP in both panels of figure \ref{fig:eep} are
% slightly evolved, with EEPs $>$ 400.
% These slightly evolved stars have two high probability modes: one at their
% true EEP and age values, and another at a lower EEP and corresponding lower
% age.
% In other words, these are subgiants being mistaken for dwarfs.
% Rotation periods do not carry information for subgiants, so including the
% rotation periods in the analysis of these stars doesn't break the degeneracy,
% and this is why stars with under-predicted EEPs are present in both panels.
% Stars with over-predicted EEPs in the right-hand panel of figure \ref{fig:eep}
% are usually dwarfs being confused for subgiants.
% The rotation periods of dwarfs are informative, so when the rotation periods
% are included in the analysis for these stars, the degeneracy is broken, the
% amplitude of the secondary mode is reduced, and their EEP is correctly
% inferred.

This simulation experiment was designed to show the theoretical improvement in
age precision when gyrochronology is incorporated into isochrone fitting.
However, it does not demonstrate the accuracy of this method because the test
data were simulated from the same model used to infer ages.
The results of this experiment are therefore extremely accurate by design.
When applying this method to real data, the results will only be accurate if
the model is accurate.
In other words, \sd, like any age-dating method, provides model-dependent
ages.
Stellar ages calculated with \sd\ depend on both the accuracy of the MIST
models {\it and} the accuracy of the gyrochronology model (equation
\ref{eqn:gyro}).
In order to test the accuracy of \sd, we applied it to real data, as described
in the following section.

\subsection{Test 2: Open clusters}
In order to test our model on real stars with known ages, we selected a sample
of stars in the 2.5 Gyr NGC 6819 cluster.
We compiled \kepler-based rotation periods \citep{meibom2015}, \Gaia\
photometry and \gaia\ parallaxes for members of the NGC 6819 cluster.
Figure \ref{fig:NGC6819} shows the period-color relation of this
cluster and figure \ref{fig:NGC6819_results} shows the results of inferring
the ages of individual cluster members using a combination of gyrochronology
and isochrone fitting (via \sd) and isochrone fitting alone.
The ages of F stars in this cluster (\gcolor\ $\sim$ 5.5-6.5) were relatively
precisely constrained by isochrone fitting alone because, at 2.5 Gyr, they are
approaching the MS turnoff.
For these hot stars, ages inferred with gyrochronology and isochrones were
similar to ages inferred with isochrones and similarly precise, showing that
isochrones provide a lot of age information for these stars and rotation
periods do not add significantly more information.
The G and early K stars in this cluster (\gcolor\ $\lesssim$ .65) were not
precisely recovered from isochrone fitting alone -- the isochrone-only age
posteriors tend towards the prior which is a uniform distribution between 0
and 13.8 Gyrs.
The median age of stars in the cluster was 4.27 $\pm$ 0.48 Gyr when only
isochrone fitting was used.
In contrast, including gyrochronology when inferring the ages of G and K stars
in this cluster significantly improved age precision.
The median age of stars in this cluster was 2.63 $\pm$ 0.16 Gyr when ages were
inferred with a combination of isochrone fitting and gyrochronology, using the
newly calibrated Praesepe-based gyrochronology model.
The previously-calibrated \citet{angus2015} model resulted in a median stellar
age of 2.66 $\pm$ 0.21 Gyr, which is still consistent with the established
cluster age of 2.5 Gyr.
The median age of stars in the cluster using uncorrected photometry was
slightly underestimated at 1.86 $\pm$ 0.22 Gyr.
This suggests that, despite the fact that V-band extinction is marginalized
over during the inference process, correcting for extinction {\it before} ages
are estimated will reduce bias introduced by dust.

We found that 5\% rotation period uncertainties resulted in the most accurate
ages for NGC 6819.
The uncertainties on the measured rotation periods, provided in
\citet{meibom2015} and shown in figure \ref{fig:NGC6819}, were likely
underestimated for some stars.
Underestimated rotation period uncertainties can result in inaccurate age
estimates.
This raises the question: how should uncertainties on rotation periods be
estimated?
The likelihood is weighted by the inverse variance, so uncertainties on the
rotation period control the relative information provided by gyrochronology,
isochrones, and the prior.
If rotation period uncertainties are either too large or too small, the
resulting age estimate will be imprecise and/or inaccurate.
It is difficult to measure uncertainties on rotation periods directly:
standard techniques such as Lomb-Scargle periodograms and autocorrelation
functions do not provide them.
% In general, formal rotation period uncertainties should probably be calculated
% empirically via simulations as in the \citet{aigrain2015} study.
\racomment{Ideally, rotation period uncertainties should capture {\it both} the
measurement precision, {\it and} the physical uncertainty introduced by the
latitudinal movement of star spots on the surface of a differentially rotating
star.
For example, \citet{donahue1996} demonstrated that the seasonal variation in
measurements of G and K star rotation periods is a function of period, $\Delta
\mathrm{P_{rot}} \propto \mathrm{P_{rot}}^{1.3\pm0.1}$.
This variation is presumably caused by a latitudinal drift in the dominant
active regions, which traces the stellar cycle over several years, in
combination with latitudinal differential rotation.
This suggests that latitudinal spot drifting does not significantly
affect stellar rotation periods when stars are young, for example the scatter
of rotation periods about the mean gyrochronology model in Praesepe is only
around 5\%.
However it is likely that this effect will become more important at older
ages.
% The impact of this phenomenon on gyrochronology remain to be seen, and an
% in-depth study is warranted.
A thorough exploration of how rotation period uncertainties, from both
measurement uncertainty and physical variation, affect stellar ages via
gyrochronology is key to understanding the power of gyrochronology as an
age-dating method.
For now, we leave this exploration for a future study.}

\subsection{Test 3: Kepler asteroseismic stars}
\racomment{In order to test our method in the regime where both isochrone
fitting and gyrochronology become important, we recovered the ages of the 21
asteroseismic stars analysed in \citet{vansaders2016}.
These 21 stars were observed in \kepler's short cadence mode and are a mixture
of dwarfs and subgiants.
Their asteroseismic ages were calculated from the analysis of the frequencies
of individual oscillation modes \citep{mathur2012, metcalfe2014,
silvaaguirre2015, ceillier2016}, and their rotation periods from their
\kepler\ light curves \citep{garcia2014}.
We crossmatched these stars with the \Gaia\ catalog to obtain parallaxes and
apparant magnitudes in the \Gaia\ G, $\mathrm{G_{BP}}$ and $\mathrm{G_{RP}}$
band passes.
We also added J, H and K 2MASS magnitudes from the Kepler input catalog
\citep{brown2011},
% asteroseismic parameters $\Delta_\nu$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ from
% \citet{ceillier2017} and \citet{serenelli2017},
and used spectroscopic effective temperatures, spectroscopic metallicities and
rotation periods reported in table 1 of \citet{vansaders2016}.
The \gaia\ photometry is extremely precise, and we found that artificially
inflating the uncertainties on \gaia\ apparent magnitudes by a factor of 10
substantially improved the quality of fit, both in terms of MCMC convergence
and agreement with asteroseismic age measurements.
In figure \ref{fig:astero} we show the ages of these 21 stars inferred using
isochrone fitting and gyrochronology, against their asteroseismic ages,
calculated using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) \citep{metcalfe2009,
metcalfe2012, metcalfe2014}.
In this figure, the colored symbols show ages inferred using a combination of
gyrochronology and isochrone fitting, implemented with the \sd\ {\it Python}
package.
The black and grey triangles show ages inferred from gyrochronology only,
where the mass and color of the stars were not inferred, but fixed to be the
asteroseismic mass and the \gaia\ \gcolor\ color.
These gyrochronal ages were calculated with age as the only free parameter,
without marginalizing over stellar mass, \gcolor\ color or extinction.
As a result, these gyrochronal ages are {\it not the same} as the ages given
by the maximum of the gyrochronal likelihood function used in the combined
age model, they simply represent an approximation to the gyrochronal age.
Grey triangles are shown for stars where gyrochronology is not applicable
because the stars are either too metal poor, too metal rich, or too evolved.
Black triangles are shown for stars where gyrochronology {\it is} applicable.
The white circles show ages inferred from isochrones only.
Dashed lines connect the three different age measurements for the same
stars.
}

\racomment{
Although the ages of all 21 stars shown in figure \ref{fig:astero} were
inferred with a joint isochronal and gyrochronal model, most (all but 8) were
either too evolved, too metal poor, or too metal rich for gyrochronology to
contribute any information to the ages.
These metal poor/rich or evolved stars lie in a regime where the variance on
their rotation period was artificially inflated because the gyrochronology
relations are not thoroughly understood or well calibrated.
The rotation periods of the remaining eight stars {\it did} contribute to
their inferred ages to some degree, however isochrones still dominated the age
information for some of them because these stars are relatively old and/or
relatively hot.
% Isochrones are information-rich for these hot and old stars, and this is
% exactly where gyrochronology is at its most information-poor.
}

\racomment{
In general, there is relatively poor agreement between the asteroseismic ages
and the ages inferred using \sd.
Much of this discrepancy is driven by differences in the isochronal ages,
which is likely attributable to differences between the MIST stellar evolution
models and those used in the AMP analysis: a combination of the Aarhus stellar
evolution code \citep[ASTEC][]{christensen-dalsgaard2008a} and the adiabatic
pulsation code \citep[ADIPLS][]{christensen-dalsgaard2008b}.
We compared non-rotating, Solar-metallicity MIST isochrones for middle-aged
stars with Solar-metallicity BaSTI isochrones \citep{pietrinferni2004,
hidalgo2018} and found that, for stars between 4 and 8 Gyrs, in the same
effective temperature range as the asteroseismic stars, the age discrepancy
between the two sets of models can be as large as 1-2 billion years.
The MIST isochrones lie above the BaSTI isochrones on the HR diagram, leading
to a systematic underprediction of ages.
}

\racomment{
The gyrochronal ages, where gyrochronology is applicable, do not show
excellent agreement with the asteroseismic ages either.
The four hot stars to the left in figure \ref{fig:astero} are rotating more
slowly than predicted by the Praesepe-based gyrochronology models, and as a
result their gyro-ages are older than their asteroseismic ones.
For these hot stars, two out of four have ages that are still consistent, or
close to consistent, with their asteroseismic ages.
The third star from the left is an anomalously slow rotator for its age and
mass and \citet{vansaders2016} also found this star to be surprisingly slowly
rotating.
In contrast, the star with a black triangle symbol (indicating that
gyrochronology is applicable) furthest to the right is {\it rapidly} rotating
for its mass and age, even when weakened braking is taken into account.
% Both stars are around Solar mass (1.06 \pm 0.02 and 1.0 \pm 0.03 M$_\odot$
% from left to right) and have asteroseismic ages older than the Sun (6.82 \pm
% 0.28 and 7.28 \pm 0.51 Gyr from left to right), and yet both rotate more
% rapidly than the Sun (23.2 \pm 7.4).
This star is around Solar mass (1.0 $\pm$ 0.03 M$_\odot$) and has an
asteroseismic age older than the Sun (7.28 $\pm$ 0.51 Gyr), yet rotates with a
period of only 19.8 $\pm$ 1.3 days.
This is KIC 9098294, a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital
period of around 20 days (Latham, private communication).
It is the only clear SB1 in the \citet{vansaders2016} sample, although some
others do have binary companions with long orbital periods, for which tidal
interactions are not expected to be strong.

    \caption{ A comparison of stellar ages inferred using
    asteroseismic modeling with ages inferred using a combination of isochrone
    fitting and gyrochronology.
Colored circles show ages inferred using isochrone fitting and gyrochronology
combined via the \sd\ software package.
Black triangles show the ages of all stars inferred via gyrochronology only
    and white circles show ages inferred via isochrone-fitting only.
This plot shows that, for the majority of stars in this sample, isochrone
    fitting dominates the age information and gyrochronology only contributes
    significantly for two or three stars.
This is a consequence of many of these stars being hot old, extremely metal
    rich, extremely metal poor, or evolved.
