%   - The need for better stellar ages.
The formation and evolution of the Milky Way (MW) and the planetary systems
within it are currently two topics of interest in astronomy.
Both of these fields require precise and accurate ages of thousands of stars.
Recent advances in galactic archaeology have been made using the ages of red
giants, some calculated from asteroseismology and some from spectroscopy, to
explore the age distributions of stellar populations in the MW
\racomment{\citep[\eg][]{citation}}
Red giants are highly luminous and can be observed to great distances, thus
providing age information on the scale of tens of kilo-parsecs.
Main sequence (MS) stars on the other hand, although fainter, are more
numerous and so their ages may provide new insights into the formation and
evolution of the Solar neighborhood.
MS star ages are also of great interest for studying the formation and
evolution of planetary systems.
Almost all exoplanets discovered to date orbit MS stars and it is therefore
{\it MS star} ages that are needed to capture snapshots of planet evolution.
Unfortunately, the very property that makes MS stars good hosts for habitable
planets also makes them difficult to date: they do not change substantially
over time.

%   - Why are MS ages harder than red giant ages?
Unlike the spectra and photometric colors of red giants, MS star spectra and
colors do not contain a significant amount of age information because they do
not change rapidly with age.
This is represented in the spacing of isochrones on a Hertsprung-Russell (HR)
or color-magnitude diagram (CMD).
On the MS, isochrones are tightly spaced and, even with very precise
measurements of effective temperature and luminosity, the position of a MS
star on the HR diagram may be consistent with range of isochrones spanning
several billion years.
On the giant branch however, isochrones are spread further apart, so that
sufficiently precisely measured temperatures and luminosities may yield ages
that are precise to within 20\% or better.
% Typical age uncertainties of dwarfs.
\racomment{Look at typical age uncertainties from APOGEE.}
Asteroseismology can provide precise ages of both red giant and MS stars
but due to the greater abundance of observations suitable for {\it red
giant} asteroseismology, precise red giant asteroseismic ages once again
outnumber MS ages.
% The frequencies of acoustic pulsations reveal the densities of stars, and, as
% those densities are age-dependent, can provide precise stellar age
% measurements.
% \kepler, a high-precision space-based photometric survey produces light curves
% of stars that are sometimes precise enough to detect brightness fluctuations
% caused by these acoustic pulsations.
The typical periods of red giant acoustic pulsations are long (on the orders
of hours to weeks) and can be detected using \kepler's long cadence mode of
one observation per thirty minutes, which is \kepler's most common observing
mode.
In addition, the amplitudes of red giant pulsations are typically very large,
significantly greater than \kepler's photometric noise floor.
MS stars, on the other hand, oscillate with periods of just a few minutes and
the long cadence \kepler\ observations, taken once every half-hour (which is
far above the Nyquist limit) are not capable of resolving these pulsations.
Instead, to resolve the pulsation frequencies of MS stars they must be
observed in \kepler's short cadence mode of one observation every minute.
% Around two thousand stars were observed in short cadence mode during \kepler's
% original mission.
However, since the amplitude of pulsation scales with stellar radius, the
majority of stars with asteroseismic ages successfully measured using \kepler\
short-cadence observations (of which there are currently around 500) are
subgiants.
Only a small fraction of these 500 are truly on the MS.
\racomment{How many?} This may change soon however: \kepler's short cadence
light curves have recently been reprocessed and new, precise ages for the {\it
all} stars observed in short cadence mode (around 2000 in the original
\kepler\ mission) may be measured shortly.

%   - Introduce gyrochronology
A star like the Sun will increase in luminosity by only around a factor of two
before turning off the MS.
In addition, the Sun's temperature will only increase by around 100 K during
its $\sim$8 billion year MS lifetime.
Luminosity and temperature are not sensitive age proxies for Sun-like stars
and can also be difficult to measure, with their precision highly sensitive to
their distance and the amount of extincting dust along the line of sight.
On the other hand, due to magnetic braking the Sun's rotation period will vary
by almost an order of magnitude over its MS lifetime.
Stellar rotation periods are much more sensitive to age than luminosity or
temperature and can be measured precisely with little dependence on distance
and none on extinction.
% Incorporating rotation period measurements into isochrone fitting methods
% provides additional information that allows for much more precise age
% inference.
Gyrochronology, the dating method that uses stellar rotation periods, has the
potential to provide MS star ages that are precise to around 20\%
\citep{epstein2014}.
Due to the abundance of rotation periods of MS stars already provided by
\kepler/\ktwo\ and the many more expected from future photometric surveys,
gyrochronology is one of the most readily available methods for inferring
precise stellar ages and, as such, has gained interest over the last few
years.

%   - How does gyrochronology work?
Magnetic braking in MS stars was first observed by \citet{Skumanich1972} who,
using observations of young clusters and the Sun, found that the rotation
periods of Solar-type stars decay with the square-root of time.
It has since been established that the rotation period of a star depends, to
first order, only on its age and mass \citep[\eg][]{barnes2003}.
This means that by measuring a star's rotation period and a suitable mass
proxy (B-V color is commonly used), one can determine its age.
The convenient characteristic of stars that allows their ages to be inferred
from their {\it current} rotation periods and independently of their
primordial ones, comes from the steep dependence of spin-down rate on rotation
period \citep{kawaler1989}.
Observations of young clusters indicate that stellar angular momentum loss
rate is proportional to the cube of the angular velocity.
This means that a star spinning with high angular velocity will experience a
much greater angular momentum loss rate than a slowly spinning star.
For this reason, no matter the initial rotation period of a Sun-like star,
after around the age of the Hyades, ($\sim$ 600 Myr) stellar rotation periods
appear to converge onto a tight sequence.
After this time, the age of a star can be inferred, to first order, from its
mass and rotation period alone.

% % Explain the project (add more detail here.)
% In this work we present and test a new age-dating model that combines stellar
% evolution models with an empirical gyrochronology model in a Bayesian
% framework.
% This approach has an advantage over either isochrone fitting or gyrochronology
% alone since the addition of age-relevant information will always improve
% stellar age estimates, unless the models are wrong.

%   - Theoretical vs empirical gyro models
The relation between age, rotation period and mass has been studied in detail
\racomment{CITATIONS}, and several different models have been developed to
capture the rotational evolution of Sun-like stars.
Some of these models are theoretical and based on physical processes;
modeling angular momentum loss as a function of the stellar properties, plus
the properties of the magnetic field and stellar wind.
Other models are empirical and capture the behavior of stars from a purely
observational standpoint, using simple functional forms that can reproduce the
data.
Both types of model; theoretical and empirical, must be calibrated using
observations.
Even the theoretical models are highly sensitive to some stellar properties
that are not measurable: mass-loss rate and magnetic field geometry, for
example.
However, despite significant advances in both types of model,
% theoretical models of stellar spin-down as well as new calibrations of
% empirical models,
the gyrochronology relations have not yet been finalized for two main reasons.
Firstly, the rotational evolution of stars is complex and not well understood.
It is difficult to reproduce the trends in the data using the known physical
processes acting within stellar interiors, surfaces and winds.
It is also challenging to come up with an empirical model that is flexible
enough to capture trends in the data.
Secondly, there is a lack of suitable calibration stars with precisely
measured ages, particularly at old ages.  % and low masses.
% These regions of parameter space are especially important because some
% evidence suggests that rotational evolution goes through a transition at old
% ages and low masses.
This region of parameter space is especially important because new evidence
suggests that rotational evolution goes through a transition at old age.
For example, old \kepler\ asteroseismic stars rotate more rapidly than
expected given their age \citep[\eg][]{Angus2015, vansaders2016}.
\citet{vansaders2016} introduced a new, physically motivated, gyrochronology
model that can reproduce these data.
It relaxes magnetic breaking at a critical Rossby number, $Ro$ (the ratio of
rotation period to the convective overturn timescale) of around the Solar
value, 2.1.
This model predicts that, after stellar rotation periods lengthen enough to
move stars cross this $Ro$ threshold, stars stop spinning down and maintain a
constant rotation period from then until they evolve off the MS.
The implication is that the ages of stars with $Ro >$ 2.1 cannot be measured
from their rotation periods.

%   - Motivation for improvements to gyrochronology relations
Despite recent advances in rotation-dating, there is substantial room for
improvement in the gyrochronology relations.
For example, there is, as yet no {\it fully} empirical gyrochronology model
that includes a weakened magnetic braking law after the $Ro$ = 2.1 transition.
In addition, no single gyrochronology relation can reproduce the rotational
behaviour of all open clusters; the relation between rotation period, age and
mass varies from cluster to cluster in a way that cannot be captured by
any current model.
New asteroseismic calibrators will become available from reprocessed \kepler\
short cadence light curves, however significant numbers of suitable
gyrochronology calibrators may not be accessible until after the European
Space Agency's \plato\ mission is launched.

%   - Describe the project presented here.
The \citet{vansaders2016} gyrochronology models that capture post
$Ro$-threshold, rotational evolution are the state-of-the-art in rotation
dating.
% developed and calibrated in \citet{epstein2014, vansaders2015,
% vansaders2016, vansaders2018}
However, despite their superior accuracy, they are expensive to compute and,
just as with most isochrones and stellar evolution tracks, are usually
pre-computed over a grid of stellar parameters in order to perform
computionally tractable inference.
Inferring ages using these models is similar to inferring an age using any set
of isochrones, with the main difference being that rotation period is an
additional dimension.
Ages calculated using these models are therefore likely to be more precise
than using rotation-free isochrones since rotation period provides an
additional anchor-point for the age of a star.
% In order to infer an age from these models, one would effectively perform
% isochrone fitting but in this case, rotation period would be added as an
% additional parameter and the ages inferred would therefore be more precise and
% accurate.
We present here a complementary method that combines isochrones with an
empirical gyrochronology model using a Bayesian framework.
The methodology is related to the \citet{vansaders2016} models described above
in that both use a combination of rotation periods and other observable
properties that track stellar evolution on the HR diagram in concert.
The main difference is that the gyrochronology model used here is an entirely
empirically calibrated one, as opposed to a physically derived one.
One major advantage of using a physically motivated gyrochronology model over
an empirically calibrated one is the ability to rely on physics to interpolate
or extrapolate over parts of parameter space with sparse data coverage.
However, rotational spin-down is a complex process that is not yet fully
understood and currently no physical model can accurately reproduce all the
data available.
For this reason, even physically motivated gyrochronology models cannot always
be used to reliably extrapolate into unexplored parameter space.
A downside of using a physical model is that it is difficult to build in an
element of stochasticity.
In other words, rotation period and mass measurements will correspond to a
{\it single} age prediction.
On the other hand, it is relatively easy to adjust the level of determinism in
empirical gyrochronology relations so that rotation period and mass
measurements will lead to a probability distribution over ages.
This is a desirable feature of a gyrochronology model because rotational
spin-down is a noisy process.
In a deterministic model a star with a rotation period that misrepresents its
age will have an incorrectly but precisely inferred age.
If however, some allowance for outliers or instrinsic scatter is built into
the models, such a star would be recognized as an outlier and would have an
imprecisely inferred age.
% Combining an empirical model with an isochronal model allows additional
% flexibility to be build into the gyrochronology relations.
% Two
Although we use a simple version of an empirical gyrochronology model in this
work, which, like any other gyrochronology model, cannot yet reproduce all the
observed data, several simple modifications could be made to this model that
{\it would} produce significant improvements.
For example, an allowance for outliers; stars with anomalously fast or slow
rotation periods, could be build into our model.
Ultimately, the model we present here will provide a baseline against which
more physically motivated models, e.g. the \citet{vansaders2016} models, can
be compared.

% % Inconsistency and inaccuracy of models
% In addition to the difficulties imposed by the slow timescale for change
% within MS stars that results in poor age precision, different dating methods
% often produce inconsistent predictions for the age of a star as a result of
% model inaccuracies.
% For example, an asteroseismic age will not necessarily agree with a isochronal
% one and even isochronal ages derived from different stellar evolution models
% can be inconsistent.
% % physics driving models are wrong.
% % Not enough calibration data.
% This problem arises from a lack of calibrators with sufficiently precise
% stellar properties.

There is still some way to go before the models we use to age-date
MS stars produce precise and accurate ages.
This paper presents an incremental step toward improving age-dating models and
best-practises.
It also provides a discussion on the balance between accuracy and precision
within age-dating models.

% Paper outline
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper is laid out as follows.
In section \ref{sec:method} we describe our new age-dating model and its
implementation, in section \ref{sec:results} we test this model on simulated
stars, cluster stars and asteroseismic stars, and in section
\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the implications of these tests and future
pathways for development.
