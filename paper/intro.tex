% The need for better stellar ages.
The formation and evolution of the Milky Way (MW) and the planetary systems
within it are two topics of significant interest to the astronomical community
today.
Both of these fields require precise and accurate ages of thousands of stars.
Recent advances in galactic archaeology have made use of the ages of red giant
stars, some derived from asteroseismology and some from spectroscopy.
The age distribution of stellar populations in the MW have been explored using
these stellar ages.
Red giants are highly luminous and can be observed to great distances, thus
providing age information on the scale of tens of kilo-parsecs.
Main sequence (MS) stars on the other hand, although fainter, are more
numerous and their ages may provide new insights into the formation and
evolution of the Solar neighborhood.
MS star ages are also of great interest for studying the formation and
evolution of planetary systems.
Almost all exoplanets discovered to date orbit MS stars and it is therefore
the ages of MS stars that are needed to capture snapshots of planet evolution.
Unfortunately, the very property that makes MS stars good hosts for habitable
planets also makes them difficult to date: they do not change substantially
over time.

% For main sequence (MS) stars however, age is a difficult property to infer.
% This is predominantly because hydrogen burning stars do not change
% appreciably during their time spent on the MS:
A star like the Sun will increase in luminosity by only around a factor of two
before turning off the MS.
In addition, the Sun's temperature will only increase by around 100 K during
its $\sim$8 billion year MS lifetime.
Luminosity and temperature are not sensitive proxies for age and can also be
difficult to measure with their precision highly sensitive to their distance
and the amount of extincting dust along the line of sight.
On the other hand, Sun's rotation period will vary by almost an order of
magnitude over its MS lifetime.
Stellar rotation periods are much more sensitive to age than luminosity or
temperature and can be measured precisely with little dependence on distance
and none on extinction.
Incorporating rotation period measurements into isochrone fitting methods
provides additional information that allows for much more precise age
inference.

% Inconsistency and inaccuracy of models
In addition to the difficulties imposed by the slow timescale for change
within MS stars that results in poor age precision, different dating methods
often produce inconsistent predictions for the age of a star as a result of
model inaccuracies.
For example, an asteroseismic age will not necessarily agree with a isochronal
or rotational age.
Even isochronal ages derived from different stellar evolution models can be
inconsistent.

% Gyrochronology
%-----------------------

Due to the abundance of rotation periods for MS stars already provided by
\kepler/\ktwo\ and the many more expected from future photometric surveys,
rotation-dating, or `gyrochronology' is one of the most readily available
methods for inferring stellar ages.
Magnetic braking in MS stars was observed by \citet{Skumanich1972} who, using
observations of young clusters and the Sun, found that the rotation periods of
Solar-type stars decay with the square-root of time.
Now, the relation between rotation period and age is well-established and has
been studied in detail \racomment{CITATIONS}.
The convenient characteristic of stars that allows their ages to be inferred
from their {\it current} rotation periods, not their primordial ones, comes
from the steep dependence of spin-down rate on rotation period.
Observations of young clusters indicate that stellar angular momentum loss
rate is proportional to the cube of the angular velocity.
This means that a star spinning with high angular velocity will experience a
much greater angular momentum loss rate than a slowly spinning star.
For this reason, no matter the initial rotation period of a Sun-like star,
after around the age of the Hyades, ($\sim$ 600 Myr) stellar rotation periods
appear to converge onto a tight sequence.
After this time, the age of a star can be inferred, to first order, from its
mass and rotation period alone.

Despite significant advances in theoretical models of stellar spin-down as
well as new calibrations of empirical models, the gyrochronology relations
have not yet been finalized.
In particular, they suffer from a lack of suitable calibration stars at old
ages and low masses.
These regions of parameter space are particularly important because some
evidence suggests that rotational evolution changes at old ages and low
masses.
For example, recent results show that old \kepler\ asteroseismic stars rotate
more rapidly than expected given their age \citep[\eg][]{Angus2015,
vansaders2016}.
These data can be reproduced with a model that relaxes magnetic breaking at a
critical Rossby number, $Ro$ (the ratio of rotation period to the convective
overturn timescale) of around the Solar value.
As stellar rotation periods lengthen and stars cross this $Ro$ threshold, they
maintain a constant rotation period after that time.
The gyrochronology model described in \citet{vansaders2016} and
\citet{vansaders2018} includes weakened magnetic braking after stars reach the
Solar $Ro$ threshold.

The models developed and calibrated in \citet{epstein2014, vansaders2015,
vansaders2016, vansaders2018} are expensive to compute and, just as with most
isochrones and stellar evolution tracks, are usually pre-computed over a grid
of stellar parameters in order to perform tractable inference.
In order to infer an age from these models, one would effectively perform
isochrone fitting but in this case, rotation period would be added as an
additional parameter and the ages inferred would therefore be more precise and
accurate.
In liu of these models becoming readily available to the community, we develop
here a complementary method that combines isochrones with an empirical
gyrochronology model using a hierarchical Bayesian model.
The methodology presented here is related to the family of models described
above in that both use a combination of rotation periods and other observable
properties that track evolution on the Hertzprung-Russell diagram in concert.
A major difference is that the gyrochronology model used here is an entirely
empirically calibrated one, as opposed to a physically derived one.
One major advantage of using a physically motivated gyrochronology model over
an empirically calibrated one is the ability to rely on physics to interpolate
or extrapolate over parts of parameter space with sparse data coverage.
However, rotational spin-down is a complex process that is not yet fully
understood and currently no physical model can accurately reproduce all the
data available.
For this reason, even physically motivated gyrochronology models cannot always
be used to reliably extrapolate into unexplored parameter space.
Although we use a simple version of an empirical gyrochronology model in this
work, which, like the physical gyrochronology models, cannot yet reproduce all
the observed data, several simple modifications could be made to this model
that {\it would} produce significant improvements.
For example, including and allowing for outliers; stars with anomalously fast
or slow rotation periods, could be incorporated into our model.
Ultimately, the model we present here will provide a baseline against which
more physically motivated models, e.g. the \citet{vansaders2016} models, can
be compared.
