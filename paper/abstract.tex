We present a new age-dating technique that combines two established methods,
gyrochronology and isochrone fitting, to infer precise ages for field stars.
This new method provides ages with a median theoretical precision of 10\%
across the MS and subgiant branch.
Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are independent age-dating methods, each
capable of providing extremely precise ages in certain areas of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Combined, they can be applied to a much broader range of stellar masses and
evolutionary stages and can provide ages that are more precise and accurate
than either method in isolation.
Rotation periods supply precise ages for cool stars on the main sequence via
gyrochronology and isochrone fitting provides precise ages near main sequence
turn off.
In this investigation, we demonstrate that the placement of a star on the
Hertzsprung-Russell or color-magnitude diagram
% observables of main sequence
% stars used to trace core hydrogen burning and stellar evolution on the
% Hertzprung-Russell diagram (\teff, \feh, \logg, parallax, apparent magnitude
% and photometric colors)
can be combined with its \kepler\ rotation period, in a Bayesian framework, to
infer a precise age from both isochrone fitting and gyrochronology
simultaneously.
We show that incorporating rotation periods into stellar evolution models
significantly improves the precision of inferred ages on the main sequence.
For late F, GK and early M field dwarfs, this new method can provide ages with
5\% precision, which is an order of magnitude improvement over using isochrone
fitting alone.
However, since ages predicted with gyrochronology on the main sequence are, in
general, much more precise than isochronal ages, care must be taken to ensure
the gyrochronology relation being used is accurate.
% The goal of this study is to explore the power of combining two independent
% dating methods, not to recalibrate or improve upon existing gyrochronology
% models.
% However, only a slight modification to our algorithm would be required to
% perform a calibration and, since the code is modular, an updated
% gyrochronology model could easily replace the one used here in future.
This publication is accompanied by an open source {\it Python} package called
\sd, for inferring stellar ages for main sequence stars and subgiants from
rotation periods, spectroscopic parameters and/or apparent magnitudes and
parallaxes.
