We present a new technique that combines two different established age-dating
methods: gyrochronology and isochrone fitting to infer precise stellar ages.
This method provides ages with 20\% precision across the MS and subgiant
branch.
Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are independent age-dating methods, each
capable of providing extremely precise ages in certain areas of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Combined, they can be applied to a much broader range of stellar masses and
evolutionary stages and can provide ages that are more precise and accurate
than either method in isolation.
Rotation periods supply precise ages for cool stars on the main sequence via
gyrochronology and isochrone fitting provides precise ages near main sequence
turn off.
In this investigation, we demonstrate that the observables of main sequence
stars used to trace core hydrogen burning and stellar evolution on the
Hertzprung-Russell diagram (\teff, \feh, \logg, parallax, apparent magnitude
and photometric colors) can be combined with \kepler\ rotation periods, in a
Bayesian framework, to infer precise stellar ages from both isochrone fitting
and gyrochronology simultaneously.
We show that incorporating rotation periods into stellar evolution models
significantly improves the precision of inferred ages on the main sequence.
However, since ages predicted with gyrochronology on the main sequence are, in
general, much more precise than isochronal ages, care must be taken to ensure
the gyrochronology relation being used is accurate.
The goal of this study is to explore the power of combining two independent
dating methods, not to recalibrate or improve upon existing gyrochronology
models.
However, only a slight modification to our algorithm would be required to
perform a calibration and, since the code is modular, an updated
gyrochronology model could easily replace the one used here in future.
This publication is accompanied by open source code ({\it Python} package,
\sd), for inferring stellar ages for cool main sequence stars and subgiants
from rotation periods, spectroscopic parameters and/or apparent magnitudes and
parallaxes.
