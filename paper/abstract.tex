We present a method and {\it Python} package, \sd, for inferring stellar ages
using a combination of two different dating methods: gyrochronology and
isochrone fitting.
This combined method provides ages with 20\% uncertainties across the MS and
subgiant branch.
The ages of cool field stars on the main sequence are difficult to measure
with classical stellar evolution models, however rotation periods can provide
precise ages for these stars via gyrochronology.
Isochrone fitting cannot provide precise ages for main sequence field stars
but it {\it can} provide precise ages near main sequence turn off.
The combination of gyrochronology and isochrone fitting, two independent
age-dating methods, each capable of providing extremely precise ages in
certain areas of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, can be applied to a much
broader range of stellar masses and evolutionary stages and provides ages that
are more precise and accurate than either method in isolation.
In this investigation, the observables of main sequence stars that are used to
trace core hydrogen burning and stellar evolution on the Hertzprung-Russell
diagram (\teff, \feh, \logg, parallax, apparent magnitude and photometric
colors) are combined with \kepler\ rotation periods, in a Bayesian framework,
to jointly infer stellar ages from both isochrone fitting and gyrochronology
simultaneously.
We show that incorporating rotation periods into stellar evolution models
significantly improves the precision of inferred ages on the main sequence.
However, since ages predicted with gyrochronology on the main sequence are, in
general, much more precise than isochronal ages, care must be taken to ensure
the gyrochronology relation being used is accurate.
The goal of this study was to explore the process of combining two independent
dating methods, not to recalibrate or improve upon existing gyrochronology
models.
However, only a slight modification to our algorithm would be required to
perform a calibration and, since the code is modular, an updated
gyrochronology model could easily replace the one used here in future.
This publication is accompanied by open source code for inferring stellar ages
for cool main sequence stars and subgiants from spectroscopic parameters
and/or apparent magnitudes, parallaxes and rotation periods.
